globs: **/src/main/java/**/*
alwaysApply: true
---
- Framework: Java Spring Boot 3.4.5 with Java 21
- Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Lombok, Validation, Actuator, Kafka
- All request and response handling must be done only in RestController classes
- All business logic must be implemented in Service layer
- All database operation logic must be done in ServiceImpl classes, which must use methods provided by Repositories
- RestControllers cannot autowire Repositories directly unless absolutely beneficial to do so
- ServiceImpl classes cannot query the database directly and must use Repositories methods, unless absolutely necessary
- Data transfer between layers must be done using DTOs, not entity classes
- Entity classes must be used only for database persistence
- Use application.properties/application.yml for configuration settings
- Implement environment-specific configurations using Spring Profiles
- Use @ConfigurationProperties for type-safe configuration properties
- Use Spring Boot 3.x features including improved auto-configuration and native compilation support
