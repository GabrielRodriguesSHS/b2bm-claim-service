- Must annotate entity classes with @Entity.
- Entity classes must be annotated with @Entity and optionally @Table from javax.persistence
- Use Lombok annotations appropriately: @Data, @Getter, @Setter, @NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor
- Annotate entity ID with @Id and @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
- Use appropriate column constraints: @Column(nullable=false, length=255, etc.)
- Use validation annotations: @NotNull, @Size, @Email, etc.
- Use FetchType.LAZY for relationships (OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany) unless specified otherwise
- Implement proper cascading strategies for relationships
- Include proper toString, equals, and hashCode methods (via Lombok or manual implementation)
- Consider using @EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class) with @CreatedDate, @LastModifiedDate for auditing fields
